### Steps to Ace a Software Engineering Interview

1. **Understand the Challenge:**
   - Solving numerous coding questions on platforms like LeetCode alone isnâ€™t enough.

2. **Prepare with a Framework:**
   - Organize thoughts clearly during the interview.
   - Focus on three key stages: 
     - Plan your code.
     - Write your code.
     - Explain your code.

3. **Stage 1: Plan Your Code**
   - **Clarify the problem**:
     - Ask for inputs and outputs.
     - Verify edge cases (e.g., input size, negative numbers).
   - **Start with a simple solution**:
     - Propose a basic approach before optimizing.
     - Avoid solving a harder problem than required.
   - **Explain your algorithm**:
     - Break down the problem-solving approach step by step.

4. **Stage 2: Write Your Code**
   - **Outline the solution**:
     - Write down algorithm steps and key data structures.
     - Communicate the plan with the interviewer before coding.
   - **Speak while coding**:
     - Narrate the thought process during implementation.
     - If you struggle to multitask, explain first and then code.
   - **Handle coding challenges**:
     - If stuck, leave a comment (TODO) and continue coding.
     - Revisit the issue if needed after completing other parts.

5. **Stage 3: Explain Your Code**
   - **Communicate effectively**:
     - Talk through your code, explaining each step and logic.
     - Use simple, clear language to describe your thought process.
   - **Test and optimize**:
     - Run the code against test cases, starting with small inputs.
     - Identify bottlenecks in performance and discuss potential optimizations.
     - Ask the interviewer if they want you to further optimize the code.

6. **Final Tips for Success:**
   - Use good coding practices (e.g., variable naming, readability).
   - Dry-run your code with small test cases to verify correctness.
   - Always clarify what the interviewer expects next (test or optimize).
   - Remember: Communication is as important as coding skills!
